    It's those unintelligent monsters, ain't it?
    What are they thinking? Please explain it
    Don't really need this crap, can't waste time
    What I possess can't copy and paste
    I'm doing it better
    Never settling for another regular
    Letter to my enemies, hey I'm telling ya
    Breaking you down to the level of molecular
    Better be wise when you're choosing battles it's mostly babbles you know one of those big time shady foe foes ain’t worth fighting for
    Drop these bars in my sleep, and a few more tricks up my sleeve
    It's way too late for you to leave now (get ready)

    Disturbing the peace
    Look into my eyes
    Now tell me the things you blabbing about behind my back
    The tenacity I hold, it's hard to break down
    It's too late for apologies
    It's going down now

    You're thirsty for blood
    Actually craving for love
    What you only want is dub
    Greed makes you go numb
    Purposefully blocking good thoughts
    Hey please doctor doctor
    He's about to be that patient
    Cause I'm about to knock him out cold (bring him back please)
    Whole lotta moves I make on you like dance floor and during this beat down you prolly wish that you can fast-forward (oh!)
    Don't you worry about it, I'll save some room for your last words (make sure of it)
    After I do this, do that and the third

    Disturbing the peace
    Look into my eyes
    Now tell me the things you blabbing about behind my back
    The tenacity I hold, it's hard to break down
    It's too late for apologies, It's going...

    Some things may break me
    But always get back up
    New perspective gained
    From all of the pain and stress
    And when I do come back
    I'm stronger than ever before so
    Kneel down

    Disturbing the peace
    Look into my eyes
    Now tell me the things you're blabbing about behind my back
    The tenacity I hold, it's hard to break down
    It's too late for apologies
    It's going down.
